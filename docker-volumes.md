## Docker Volumes
* Containers are ephemeral. Once you remove container you lose data. Data is not persisted by default 
* We need some kind of mechanism to store the data even if the container is removed. 
* This can be possible throgh the volumes 

They are two types of volumes:
1. Un-named volues 
2. Named volumes
