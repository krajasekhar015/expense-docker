## Docker Best Practices 

Docker has simplified building and deploying applications using containers. To get the most out of Docker, follow these best practices for creating secure, efficient, and scalable Docker images. These guidelines will help ensure smoother workflows and improved performance.

**1. Use Official and Lightweight Base Images**

*** Official Images:** Always start with trusted, official images from Docker Hub for enhanced security. For better performance, choose lightweight/minimal-base images like `alpine` instead of larger ones like ubuntu. This helps keep your images smaller and faster.

**2. Optimize Image Size**

Create your own `Dockerfile` for each application. This way, you include only the necessary files and settings through `multi-stage builds`, making your Docker image `smaller` and more `efficient`.
